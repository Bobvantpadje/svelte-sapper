## Tailwind setup

Tailwind is setup by following the following guide: https://dev.to/vannsl/configuring-tailwindcss-for-sapper-58jm. If there are any problems, please checkout the link and see if everything is still setup correctly. 

When running the application make sure to run both `npm run dev` and `npm run dev:tailwindcss`
